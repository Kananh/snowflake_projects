# Snowflake Projects

Collection of Snowflake projects I've collated.

| Folder | Description                  |
| -------| -----------------------------|
| `snowflake_setup_demo` | Scripts to quickly stand up a Snowflake DWH with example data |
| WIP - `snowflake_lightweight_framework` | <br/>* Marked as WIP as it's done, but just want to do some housekeeping.<br/>* Original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/paulf-999/snowflake_lightweight_framework)<br/>* Fuller version of `snowflake_setup_demo`, this stands up a Snowflake DWH with a series of best practice: RBAC roles, DBs and Snowflake objects (e.g., resource monitors) |
| WIP - `snowflake_s3_connectivity` | <br/>* Similarly marked as WIP as it's done, but just want to do some housekeeping.<br/>* Original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/paulf-999/snowflake_s3_connectivity)<br/> * Extends upon `snowflake_lightweight_framework` to include additional scripts to establish S3 connectivity. |
