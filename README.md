# Snowflake Projects

Collection of Snowflake projects I've collated.

| Folder | Description                  | Comments |
| -------| -----------------------------| -------- |
| `snowflake_setup_demo` | Scripts to quickly stand up a Snowflake DWH with example data | - |
| WIP - `snowflake_lightweight_framework` | * Fuller version of `snowflake_setup_demo`, this stands up a Snowflake DWH with a series of best practice: RBAC roles, DBs and Snowflake objects (e.g., resource monitors) | * Marked as WIP as it's done, but just want to do some housekeeping. |
| WIP - `snowflake_s3_connectivity` | * Extends upon `snowflake_lightweight_framework` to include additional scripts to establish S3 connectivity. | <br/>* Similarly marked as WIP as it's done, but just want to do some housekeeping. |
